# Credit-scoring-model

# Description:
A credit scoring model predicts the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan. Itâ€™s widely used by banks and lenders to assess credit risk. In this project, we build a basic binary classification model using logistic regression on simulated applicant data to predict whether an applicant is likely to default.

# ðŸ’³ What This Project Demonstrates:
* Builds a credit risk classifier using applicant data

* Handles categorical encoding and feature scaling

* Evaluates results using a classification report and confusion matrix
